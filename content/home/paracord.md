paracord is a lightwieght type of rope. it can now be found in dollar stores for a dollar and twenty five cents for a twenty five foot length. one can easily coil up twenty five feet and fit it into a pocket, though i prefer to cut it down to five or six foot lenghts and carry two or three of them to be used as needed. this cord is unique, it has an outer sheath and inner strands. when stripped out, the sheath is still plenty strong for common uses, while the seven inner strands can each be further broken down into three strands each. this means a five foot section of paracord can be turned into seven sections of twine or twenty one sections of floss, all of which are plenty strong for lashing and binding to make pack frames, bows, and other implements from sticks, and makes excellent thread to sew up and make repairs to clothes and equipment. when cutting paracord, be sure to use your lighter to melt the end closed again to prevent fraying.
