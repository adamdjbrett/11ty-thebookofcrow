lighters are important and useful. i stopped smoking many years ago but still it good to have one on hand. one can light a gas stove, light a candle, start a fire, re-light the pilot on the water heater, as well as quickly burning the stray threads off of clothing and sealing up the ends of synthetic rope. bic lighters are practically indescructible and easy to find laying around almost anywhere. make a small loop from a piece of paracord and tape it to the lighter so that it can be clipped to oneself or ones gear.
