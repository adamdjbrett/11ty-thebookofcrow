this stands for 'everyday carry', meaning the items a person has on them nearly all of the time, especially when they leave the house. the internet has made this seemingly normal thing into a subject of nearly cult-like frenzy. one should choose items for function, not vanity, and try to stick with items that are inexpensive, easily available to nearly anyone, and easily replaced. one should strive to become accustomed to solving problems with things easily found or readily at hand, not objects that are expensive or rare. core items should be small enough to carry in ones pockets without the need for a bag. here, i will list my common items and their uses.
