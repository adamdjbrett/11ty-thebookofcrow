to make a tiny emergency kit, take a drinking straw, pinch one end closed with your pliers and burn the end with the ligher, which will melt and seal it shut. this closed-ended tube can be filled with salt, pills, sewing needle and thread, matches, etc, and may be closed at the opposite end the same way, making various small waterproof kits.
