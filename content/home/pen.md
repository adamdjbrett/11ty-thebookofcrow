a marking device should always be carried for obvious reasons, for marking things or leaving notes. they may also serve as a self-defense item when going into an environment that does not allow for any other tools. a simple number 2 pencil is allowed nearly everywhere, as well as a basic bic pen or permanent marker. when in doubt, carry one of each. they are small, and will allow you to make marks on almost any surface or material. in matters of self-defense, look up and consider the uses of the kubaton or thumb-stick, these techniques can be employed with a sturdy sharpie marker.
