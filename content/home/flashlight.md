as a kid i was just crazy about flashlights. they were magical, they could defeat the darkness and be fun at the same time. as an adult, i have always carried at least a small light with me at all times, typically around my neck or in my pocket. a simple two dollar led penlight will serve most needs, so long as it can handle a splash of water and handle a drop to the ground without breaking. i look for ones that have a pocket clip that can be taken off and reversed, so that it can be clipped to the brim of my cap or onto my bandanna on my head.

when shopping for lights, pay attention to the type and number of batteries needed, the light output, and the run time. i prefer lights that have a very low setting and a run time of greater than 10 hours for small lights, and greater than 50 hours for larger lights. if you absolutely need to use it, you want to know it will last you through an entire night without fail until morning.
