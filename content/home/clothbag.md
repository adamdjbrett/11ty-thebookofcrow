by tying the two left corners to each other, and the right corners to each other, making a sort of kleenex-box or shaving-kit shaped bag with a slit in the top, easily put your things inside it. use a piece of paracord to make a shoulder strap and it becomes a handy hip-bag for the weekend or any time you dont feel like putting everything back in your pockets.
