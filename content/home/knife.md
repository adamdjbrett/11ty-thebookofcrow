i have carried a pocketknife since i recieved my own on my tenth birthday. one should learn to sharpen thier own knife, and how to carry and handle it safely. its list of uses are long and varied, but i will suffice to say it is good for opening envelopes, and for preparing and eating food on the go, which i have done plenty.
