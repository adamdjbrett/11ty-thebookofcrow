handkerchiefs, scarves, or bandannas, are pieces of cloth, usually about 18 inches square, typically made of cotton. their uses are numerous, and the various materials may lend themselves to different uses. cotton is good for absorbing material, and may be shredded finely to be used for tinder in firelighting. nylon or polyester is not as absorbent and is more flammable, do not wear it loosely near open flames. use a bandanna to cover ones head from the sun, as a headband to keep the sweat out of ones eyes, to wrap around ones hands as makeshift mittens when using sharp tools, the list goes on. best of all, it can carry all of your other gear. for this reason, i usually carry three of them, one to wear, one specifically to wipe my mouth and hands with, and the third to make a bag, if needed.
