## about crow

uncle crow is the curious force behind this field guide. i collect hard-won notes about everyday carry, cigar box guitars, and all the linux terminal tricks that keep my gear running. i like tools that are durable, repairable, and easy to pass along.

## approach
simplicity stays at the center. if the tools are inexpensive and replicable, anyone can learn them. the Book of Crow documents the mindset that favors resourcefulness over showmanship.

## projects
the front page holds the active kit inventory. come back soon for more entries.

if you’re here for the practical stuff, head back to the <a href="/">front page</a> and dive into the sections. each one is a tested note from my own kit.
