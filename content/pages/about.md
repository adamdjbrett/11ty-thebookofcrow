<h1 id="about">about crow</h1>

<p>uncle crow is the curious force behind this field guide. i collect hard-won notes about everyday carry, cigar box guitars, and all the linux terminal tricks that keep my gear running. i like tools that are durable, repairable, and easy to pass along.</p>

<h2 id="approach">approach</h2>
<p>simplicity stays at the center. if the tools are inexpensive and replicable, anyone can learn them. the Book of Crow documents the mindset that favors resourcefulness over showmanship.</p>

<h2 id="projects">projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>edc experiments and pocket-sized kits</li>
  <li>homemade instruments and cigar box builds</li>
  <li>linux workflows, shell scripts, and static sites like this one</li>
</ul>

<p>if you’re here for the practical stuff, head back to the <a href="/">front page</a> and dive into the sections. each one is a tested note from my own kit.</p>
