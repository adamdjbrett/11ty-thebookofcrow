<h1 id="lost">page not found</h1>

<p>looks like the page you wanted slipped out of the kit. the link may be old, or maybe i moved the section into another bag.</p>

<h2 id="next">try this instead</h2>
<ul>
	<li>go back to the <a href="/">home page</a> and browse the contents list</li>
	<li>check the <a href="/sitemap.xml">sitemap</a> for the exact section you need</li>
	<li>visit the <a href="/about/">about page</a> to learn what this project covers</li>
</ul>

<p>if you think something important is missing, reach out and i’ll try to restore it.</p>
